#Introduction
#In this assignment, it was asked to create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. 
#we will Host a webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. 
#The webpage must contain the date that we created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly.
